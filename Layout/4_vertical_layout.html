            man will begin to think like
            the computer" raises an important point about the potential risks of our reliance on technology. As
            computers become
            more advanced, there is a risk that humans may become too reliant on them and lose the ability to think and
            make
            decisions for themselves. This could lead to a situation where humans become passive consumers of
            information and
            decisions made by computers, rather than actively engaging in the process of analysis and decision-making.
            On the other
            hand, if humans begin to think like computers, they may become more efficient and productive, but they may
            also lose
            some of their creativity and flexibility. Thinking like a computer involves following predetermined rules
            and
            procedures, rather than considering alternative perspectives and approaches. This could lead to a
            narrow-minded and
            inflexible way of thinking that is not well-suited to the complex and dynamic world we live in. It is
            important for
            humans to maintain their own critical thinking skills and not become overly reliant on technology to make
            decisions for
            them.The saying "The real danger is not that the computer will begin to think like man, but that man will
