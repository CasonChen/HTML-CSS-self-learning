# Learn HTML and CSS myself

It all initiated because I suddenly came across a TikTok about building a website using CSS and HTML language.

I keep curious about it.

After some searching, I learned that for a website, HTML is its flesh, CSS is the skin, and JavaScript is its soul.

Briefly, this repository is about some of the materials I've used to learn HTML and CSS. I hope it can help you all!

In my self-study period, I divided my study into three main parts

- [HTML](https://github.com/CasonChen/HTML-CSS-self-learning/tree/main/HTML/CodeFiles)
- [CSS](https://github.com/CasonChen/HTML-CSS-self-learning/tree/main/CSS)
- [Layout](https://github.com/CasonChen/HTML-CSS-self-learning/tree/main/Layout)

In the part of Layout, I did two [exercises](https://github.com/CasonChen/HTML-CSS-self-learning/tree/main/Layout/Exercise).

These two exercises have boosted my confidence to learn front-end development well!!!!
